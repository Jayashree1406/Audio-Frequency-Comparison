# Audio-Frequency-Comparison
This project analyzes and compares two audio recordings using frequency-domain techniques. It extracts spectral features using FFT and visualizes both audio signals on a single frequency graph.The system demonstrates practical applications of audio signal processing and voice similarity evaluation.
