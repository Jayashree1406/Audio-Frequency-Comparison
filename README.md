🎵 Audio Frequency Comparison
📌 Project Overview
The Audio Frequency Comparison project is designed to analyze and compare the frequency components of audio signals. This project helps in understanding how different audio inputs vary in terms of frequency, which is useful in audio processing, signal analysis, and learning basic concepts of digital signal processing (DSP).
🎯 Objectives
• To analyze audio signals using frequency-domain techniques
• To compare frequencies of different audio samples
• To visualize and interpret audio frequency data
• To gain hands-on experience with audio signal processing
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: •Python
Libraries:
• NumPy
• SciPy
• Matplotlib
• Librosa (if used)
Tools:
• VS Code
• Git & GitHub
⚙️ Features
• Load and process audio files
• Extract frequency components
• Compare multiple audio signals
• Visualize frequency spectrum using graphs
🧪 How It Works
• Audio files are loaded into the program
